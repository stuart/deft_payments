Ah! DEFT Processing. Happy times...

This library actually does the bit that Admin currently does.
It pulls a PAY file from Macquarie bank and parses it into
individual transaction records.

The parser is written using the TreeTop parser DSL.
To regenerate the parser use ```rake treetop```

The transaction class has been designed for compatability with cornucopia.
A transaction is a node of the parser's output tree.

DEFT PAY FILE FORMAT

Once you understand TreeTop grammars, looking at pay_file.treetop should
make the entire payfile format easy to understand.

The pay file layout has rows laid out like this:

FILE HEADER
	BATCH HEADER
		TRANSACTIONS
		...
	BATCH FOOTER
	BATCH HEADER
		TRANSACTIONS
		...
	BATCH FOOTER
	...
FILE FOOTER

There is a single integer row identifier that tells the parser what type
of row each one is, for example a TRANSACTION is identified by starting with 2.
See the parser itself for details.

Most of the columns are fixed width or delimited by whitespace, though not all, which adds some oddities to the parser.

The parser has been tested on every pay file that we have ever receieved.

TODO: Add TXN file download and parsing. Though, from looking at
admin we do nothing more than download the TXN files and store them
for posterity.
